# Core_Java_ATMInterface
This ATM project, developed in core Java, utilizes key programming concepts such as encapsulation, exception handling, functions, statements, and random password generation. It interfaces with a MySQL database to store user data. Core functionalities include Withdrawal, Deposit, Checking Balance, Changing PIN, and Account Balance functions.

Upon initiation, the system prompts the user to select whether they are a new or existing user.

For new users, the system generates a new object, collecting essential information such as name and phone number. Subsequently, it generates a random 12-digit card number and prompts the user to create a new PIN. Additionally, new users are given the option to add funds to their account. Upon completion, all data is securely transmitted to the database.

Existing users are prompted to enter their card number and PIN for validation against existing records. Upon successful validation, users gain access to a range of operations including withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, account information retrieval, and PIN modification.

Through these enhancements, the ATM system provides an intuitive and secure platform for both new and existing users to manage their accounts effectively.
